## Summary

Y-Vent is a pressure-triggered, 3D printable, emergency ventilator. The device has no moving parts and consits of 2 pieces of plastic. It is designed around an aerodynamic behavior known as the CoandÄƒ effect (It is a bistable fluidic amplifier). The device produces cyclical pressure changes, which can support patient breathing, while allowing for patient actuation and eliminating the possibility of dissynchrony.

### Features:

- achieves PIP preasures between 0-50 [cmH2O] (adjustable using input pressure)
- regulates inhale/exhale phase (I/E time, I/E ratio)
 - provides patient with PEEP between 0-20[cmH2O] (adjustable using PEEP valve)
 - powered with a 20-140 [cmH2O] pressure source (air regulator or blower)  
 - can be actuated with patient breathing (no risk of asynchrony)
