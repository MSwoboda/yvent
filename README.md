***Disclaimer:** Y-Vent is not a medical device. Y-Vent must not replace FDA/CE-mark ventilation support. Y-Vent is an experimental device which should only be considered in emergency scenarios as an alternative to death due to equipment shortage.*

## Summary

Y-Vent is a pressure-triggered, 3D printable, emergency ventilator. The device has no moving parts and consits of 2 pieces of plastic. It is designed around an aerodynamic behavior known as the CoandÄƒ effect (It is a bistable fluidic amplifier). The device produces cyclical pressure changes, which can support patient breathing, while allowing for patient actuation and eliminating the possibility of dissynchrony.

The device can:
	- achieve PIP preasures between 0-50 [cmH2O] (adjustable using input pressure)
	- regulated inhale/exhale phase (I/E time, I/E ratio)
 	- provide patient with PEEP between 0-20[cmH2O] (adjustable using valve)
 	- powered with a 20-140 [cmH2O] pressure source (air regulator or blower)  
 	- be actuated with patient breathing (no risk of asynchrony)
